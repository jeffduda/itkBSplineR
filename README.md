# itkBSplineR - this is still a WIP
This package provides routines to interface the ITK implementation of BSplines. A
single function is provided that fits BSplines to scattered data and returns
values fitted to an evenly spaced grid.

## Install
The simplest install method is to install from R via:

library(devtools)

install_github("jeffduda/itkBSplineR")
